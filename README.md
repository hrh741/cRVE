# cRVE
cpp code to split the boundaries of electrolyte and matrix for the mesh file generated by stl in Gmsh.

Step-1. generate the RVE in [GeoDict](https://www.math2market.com/Solutions/aboutGD.php), which should give you the *.stl file.

Step-2. generate the msh file use Gmsh, which should give you the volume mesh but no any surface or boundary mesh information.

Step-3. label out all the boundaries use cRVE, especially the common surface where the particles are contacted with the cubic's edge surfaces.
